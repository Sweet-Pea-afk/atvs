    How to train your dragon is a movie franchise with three animated movies and a live-action in
    production to be released in this year (2025) still.

    "How to Train Your Dragon" began as a concept developed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, two veteran animators at DreamWorks Animation. 
    The idea was born out of a desire to create a story that would challenge traditional notions of good vs. evil and explore the complexities
    of relationships between humans and animals. Sanders and DeBlois drew inspiration from their own childhood experiences, mythology, and
    fantasy literature, as well as the world of Viking history and culture.
