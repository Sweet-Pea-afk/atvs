    "How to Train Your Dragon" is a 2010 computer-animated adventure film produced by DreamWorks Animation. 
    The movie is set in the fictional Viking village of Berk, where dragons and humans have been at war 
    for centuries. The story follows Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, a scrawny and awkward Viking teenager 
    who lives with his father, Stoick the Vast, the village chieftain. Hiccup's life takes a dramatic turn
    when he encounters a Night Fury dragon, a rare and elusive species.

    This film rolls fire-breathing action, epic adventure and big laughs into a captivating, fun and
    original story. Hiccup is a young Viking who defies tradition and befriends one of his deadliest foes
    - a ferocious dragon he calls Toothless. Together, the unlikely heroes fight against the odds to save
    both their worlds in this wonderful, feel-good hit.
