    I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty<br>
    I bet a lot of me was lost, "T"'s uncrossed and "I"'s un<br>dotted
    I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I<br> got
    Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat<br>
    I must've forgot, you can't trust me<br>
    I'm open a moment and close when you show it<br>
    Before you know it I'm lost at sea<br>
    And now that I write and think about it<br>
    And the story unfolds<br>
    You should take my life, you should take my soul<br><br>
    You are surrounding all my surroundings<br>
    Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain<br>
    You are surrounding all my surroundings<br>
    Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes<br><br>
    And I'll be holding on to you<br>
    And I'll be holding on to you<br><br>
    Remember the moment you know exactly where you're going<br>
    'Cause the next moment, before you know it<br>
    Time is slowing and it's frozen still<br>
    And the window sill looks really nice, right?<br>
    You think twice about your life, it probably happens at <br>night, right?
    Fight it, take the pain, ignite it<br>
    Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fi<br>ne and tie it
    To a tree, tell it, "You belong to me<br>
    This ain't a noose, this is a leash<br>
    And I have news for you, you must obey me"<br><br>
    You are surrounding all my surroundings<br>
    Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain<br>
    You are surrounding all my surroundings<br>
    Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes<br><br>
    Entertain my faith<br>
    Entertain my faith<br>
    Entertain my faith<br>
    Entertain my faith<br>
    Entertain my faith<br>
    Entertain my faith<br>
    Entertain my faith<br>
    Entertain my faith<br>
    Entertain my faith<br>
    Entertain my faith<br><br>
    Lean with it, rock with it<br>
    When we gonna stop with it?<br>
    Lyrics that mean nothing, we were gifted with thought<br>
    Is it time to move our feet to an introspective beat?<br>
    It ain't the speakers that bump hearts<br>
    It's our hearts that make the beat<br><br>
    Lean with it, rock with it<br>
    When we gonna stop with it?<br>

    And I'll be holding on to you<br>
