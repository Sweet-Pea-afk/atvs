        There was a wonderful structure to the city<br>
        And it put my cares to rest<br><br>

        Taking inventory of his life<br>
        Seeing snapshots chronologically in line<br>
        Something told him he should look around and tidy up<br>
        He collected many things but never quite enough<br>
        Tried looking at it from a new perspective<br>
        Flat on his back but he still heard the directive<br>
        Orders from that corner where that shadow always lived<br>
        Never asked permissions he just hopes that they forgive<br><br>

        I don't want to go like this<br>
        At least let me clean my room<br>
        I don't want to leave like this<br>
        'Cause the last thing I want to do is<br>
        Make my people make decisions<br>
        Wondering what to do, oh<br>
        Should they keep it on display<br>
        Or redecorate?<br><br>

        Blankets over mirrors, she tends to like it<br>
        She's not afraid of her reflection<br>
        But of what she might see behind it<br>
        She had plans to change her name<br>
        Just not the traditional way<br>
        Haunted by a couple big mistakes<br>
        She covers all the dents with the way she decorates<br>
        Then one night she got cold with no blankets on her bed<br>
        So she ripped them off the mirror, stepped back and she said<br><br>

        I don't want to go like this<br>
        At least let me clean my room<br>
        I don't want to leave like this<br>
        'Cause the last thing I want to do is<br>
        Make my people make decisions<br>
        Wondering what to do, oh<br>
        Should they keep it on display<br>
        Or redecorate?<br><br>

        With the bells and the whistles scaled back<br>
        Like an isolated track<br>
        And he feels trapped when he's not inebriated<br>
        Fair to say he's fairly sedated most days of the week<br>
        He might have made it if he lived on a different street<br>
        I repeat, scaled back and isolated<br>
        He says he likes an open schedule but he mostly hates it<br>
        If you're running to his room, take a breath before you break-in<br>
        Put your ear up to the door, tell me can you hear him saying?<br><br>

        I don't want to go like this<br>
        At least let me clean my room<br>
        I don't want to leave like this<br>
        'Cause the last thing I want to do is<br>
        Make my people make decisions<br>
        Wondering what to do, oh<br>
        Should they keep it on display<br>
        Or redecorate?<br><br>

        I don't want to go like this (go like this)<br>
        At least let me clean my room (clean my room)<br>
        I don't want to leave like this (leave like this)<br>
        'Cause the last thing I want to do is (to do is)<br>
        Make my people make decisions<br>
        Wondering what to do, oh<br>
        Should they keep it on display (on display)<br>
        Or redecorate?<br><br>
