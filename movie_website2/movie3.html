    </div>

    <div class="content">
    "How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World" is a 2019 computer-animated adventure film produced by 
    DreamWorks Animation. The movie is a sequel to the 2014 film "How to Train Your Dragon 2" and concludes
    the story of Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III and his dragon, Toothless. The movie takes place after the 
    events of the second film and follows Hiccup as he tries to protect the dragons and the humans from a 
    new threat, a group of dragon hunters led by Grimmel, a ruthless and cunning dragon hunter.

    From DreamWorks Animation comes a surprising tale about growing up, finding the courage to face the 
    unknown... and how nothing can ever train you to let go. What began as an unlikely friendship between 
    an adolescent Viking and a fearsome Night Fury dragon has become an epic adventure spanning their lives.
