        <p>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu was developed in the early 20th century after Japanese judoka Mitsuyo Maeda immigrated to Brazil. He taught the techniques of Kodokan Judo to Carlos Gracie, who, along with his brother HÃ©lio Gracie, adapted and modified the techniques into what became BJJ.</p>
        <p>Helio, being smaller and physically weaker, emphasized leverage, timing, and technique over brute force. His innovations transformed Jiu Jitsu into a system accessible to all body types and skill levels.</p>
