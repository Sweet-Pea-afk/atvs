    <h1 style="font-size: 40px; color: rgb(232, 248, 255);"> The evolution of the computer networking technology </h1>

    <p style="font-size: 30px; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; color: bisque;">
    Computer networking stands as one of the most transformative innovations of the modern era—enabling global communication, powering the internet, and shaping the way societies operate, collaborate, and evolve. From the cold-war-era experiments of ARPANET to today's hyperconnected world of cloud services, 5G, and billions of smart devices, networking technology has undergone profound changes in speed, scale, and sophistication.<br><br>

    This evolution didn’t happen overnight. It unfolded across distinct technological eras, each defined by breakthroughs in infrastructure, protocols, and use cases. In this article, we explore the journey of computer networking across three pivotal phases:<br>

    The Foundational Era (1960s–1970s) – when packet switching, early protocols, and ARPANET formed the digital backbone.<br>

    The Standardization and Expansion Era (1980s–1990s) – marked by the dominance of TCP/IP, the rise of the commercial Internet, and the widespread adoption of LAN technologies.<br>

    The Modern Era (2000s–Present) – a period characterized by Wi‑Fi evolution, virtualization, cloud computing, SDN, IoT, and 5G networks.<br>

    Through these eras, we’ll uncover how technological innovation, strategic necessity, and user demand have shaped the networking landscape we rely on today.<br>
