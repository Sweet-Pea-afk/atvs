TCP/IP Adoption & Protocol Wars-
TCP/IP, developed by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf in the late 1970s, was formalized in IPv4 (1981) and fully adopted on ARPANET by January 1, 1983 
        
In parallel, there was contention between TCP/IP and OSI models—a battle eventually won by TCP/IP by the mid-1990s

        DNS & Commercial Expansion -
        The Domain Name System (DNS) debuted in 1983, offering human-readable addressing

        Local Networking & LAN Standards -
        Ethernet grew into dominant LAN technology in the 1980s; alongside it, IBM’s Token Ring (IEEE 802.5) emerged in 1984 though later eclipsed by Ethernet

        Wi‑Fi Beginnings -
        ALOHAnet (1971) prefigured wireless network concepts 
        Later, the IEEE 802.11 (Wi‑Fi) standard was introduced in 1997, laying groundwork for wireless LANs
