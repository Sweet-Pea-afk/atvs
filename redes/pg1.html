    <ol style="font-size: 30px; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; color: bisque;">
        <li>Packet Switching Concepts -
            Innovated independently by Paul Baran (RAND Corporation) and Donald Davies (UK), packet switching enabled data to be broken into packets and routed dynamically—a radical departure from circuit-switched models
        </li>
        <li>ARPANET & Early Connectivity -
            ARPANET, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, began taking shape with the first nodes linked by UCLA and SRI in 1969; the inaugural message ("LO") sent on October 29 sparked the birth of the modern Internet
        </li>

        <li>Protocols & Infrastructure -
            First RFCs issued in April 1969
            Network Control Program (NCP), enabling Telnet and FTP, emerged around 1970
        </li>

        <li>Ethernet (1973, Xerox PARC), SATNET, first routers (~1974), and true IP routers (~1976) all marked critical forward leaps
        </li>
</ol>
